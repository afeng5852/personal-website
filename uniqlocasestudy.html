      <h1>
        01: Overview
      </h1>
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>UNIQLO was founded in Yamaguchi, Japan in 1949. It first started as a
      textiles manufacturer before expanding to the global clothing brand that we know today.
      Known for their simplistic and quality apparel, no wonder it has amassed so many loyal customers.
      </p>
      <h3>The Journey</h3>
      <p>
        My journey with the UNIQLO app began when they were having
        an in-app only promotion for their HEATTECH attire. Like any
        college student, I could not pass up on free clothing, so I
        downloaded the app for the first time. Right away, the
        app felt different from the other apps I was accustomed to -
        Urban Outfitters, American Eagle, and H&M. I was frustrated
        with its slow loading time, intrusive pop-ups, and web wrap UI.
        I realized that others felt the same way, so I embarked
        on this journey to fix some of these issues.

        02: User Research
      </h1>
      <h3>
        User Testing and Surveys
      </h3>
      <p>
        To understand user paint points and the user journey, I asked
        users to freely use the app while screen recording. Afterwards, I instructed them
        to answer some questions about their experience. Here are some of the questions below:
      </p>
      <li>
        Explain the process of completing a purchase using the UNIQLO app
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        How easy was it to navigate the app?
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        What are the most convenient and inconvenient features of the app?
      </li>
      <h3> Results</h3>
      <p>Below is one of the user journeys that I found interesting. This user, like the others,
        was frustrated with the return feature. Instead of utitilizing the back button that
        is displayed on the top left, they had to resort to clicking the logo which returned back to the
        home screen.</p>
      <video id="video" width="700px" height="600px;" src="pics/helen.mov" controls autoplay>
        <!-- <source src="pics/helen.mov" type="video/mov"> -->
      </video>
      <p> After interviewing the other 8 participants and analyzing their videos, I was able to understand some of their
        pain points and frustrations with using the app. Here are some of the key takeaways
        from the findings:
      </p>
      <br>
      <img id="affinity_diagram" src="pics/Frame 1.png" alt="">
      <p>I realized that many of their frustrations came from the app's navigation which they found
        confusing to complete tasks. They had a hard time interacting with interface because the
        web-wrapping and pop-up messages made it inconvenient. They also never interacted with the app's others
        features like Blog, Store Locator, and My Account, because they were on the app solely to browse and not buy.
        The navigation on the top was also left untouched, because they saw no need to use it. </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        However, there were some features that the users did enjoy using -
        coupons, store availability, categories. After organizing the data into the affinity diagram, I was
        ready to create a persona to further understand the users' needs and demands. </p>
      <br>
      <img id="persona" src="pics/persona.png" alt="">
      <!-- <p>Here are some quotes from the interviews that I found insightful: </p>
        <h4>The interface seems like you're using their website on a mobile browser.
          It doesn't feel like an app. Also, it's annoying how once you select a category (men, women, baby, and etc), you can't really go back and forth easily.
          You would have to close the pop out window to browse another category.</h4>
          <h4>When you click on anything, it pulls up their website/diff tab so if
            you want to go back you have to exit out completely of your current tab.</h4> -->
      <p>User research led me to conclude that improving navigation and eliminating redudancy were at heart
        of user pains. The app had many features that either users were not aware of or did not find a use for.
        This meant making the UI clear and concise to improve their experiences. </p>

      <h1>03: Market Research</h1>
      <p>I looked at other clothing companies' apps (Urban Outfitters, H&M, and American Eagle) to draw some inspiration but to also
      see how they addressed some of the concerns that UNIQLO's users had. I realized that the other apps prioritized
      a clean UI and simple UX. For example, all of the other apps had featured items without having to bombard users with promotions.
      Here are some of
    the key takeways from this cross-analysis:  </p>
    </div> -->
    <div class="Wireframing" id="Wireframing">
      <h1>03: Wireframing</h1>
      <p>I began with low fidelity wireframes to get a general direction of the redesign. My main concern was making the UI
        simplistic and consistent not only to improve the UX but to also be consistent with UNIQLO's brand.</p>
      <img id="lo-fi-wireframe" src="pics/IMG-4717.jpg" alt="">
      <p>Once I got a sense of the layout and aesthetic, I moved onto mid-fidelity wireframes. Here, I continued designing
        the other pages and began structuring them with content.</p>
      <iframe id="mid-fi-wireframe" style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450"
        src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FBQxI3Rfw69LgcOkE3mLCKj%2FWireframe-Copy%3Fnode-id%3D0%253A1&chrome=DOCUMENTATION" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <hr>
    </div>
    <div class="Prototype" id="Prototype">
      <h1>04: Prototype</h1>
      <p>After creating the mid-fidelity wireframes, I started to design a working prototype. I made sure to be consistent with
        UNIQLO's minimalistic UI.</p>
      <iframe id="prototype" style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450"
        src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2F4AnLIteqIQtS6CQ4eQTgbt%2FWireframe%3Fnode-id%3D12%253A24%26scaling%3Dscale-down&chrome=DOCUMENTATION" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    <div class="Reflection" id="Reflection">
      <h1>05: Reflection</h1>
      <p>This was my first UI/UX case study and it was an exciting and fun project to work on. I learned a lot about
        user research and its great importance in design. I also really enjoyed the visual design process and got better
        at using Figma and Adobe Illustrator. Here are my key takeaways from this project:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Don't rush the process. This was my first project so I was very eager to show what I knew. Instead, I should
          have taken more time in between each step to fully analyze my data. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Focus more on UX. I spent too much time on prototyping and creating a beautiful redesign. Design is more than just
          pretty visuals, but a focus on the users and their thinking. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Nevertheless, I'm proud of what I did and this was a great learning experience. I look forward to my next
        project and improving my design skills.</p>
