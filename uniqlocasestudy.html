        01: Overview
      </h1>
      <p>
        My journey with the Uniqlo app began when they were having
        an in-app only promotion for their HEATTECH attire. Like any
        college student, I could not pass up on free clothing, so I
        downloaded the app for the first time. Right away, the
        app felt different from the other apps I was accustomed to -
        Urban Outfitters, American Eagle, and H&M. I was frustrated
        with its slow loading time, intrusive pop-ups, and web wrap UI.
        I realized that others felt the same way, so I embarked
        on this journey to fix some of these issues.

      </h1>
      <h3>
        User Testing and Surveys
      </h3>
        <p>
          To understand user paint points and the user journey, I asked
          users to freely use the app and to answer some of my concerns noted
          below:
        </p>
        <li>
          Explain the process of completing a purchase using the Uniqlo app
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          How easy was it to navigate the app?
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          What are the most convenient and inconvenient features of the app?
        </li>
        <h3> User Pain Points</h3>
        <div class="Search">
          <h4>Search</h4>
          <li>
            "The filter feature is not really that helpful, especially the color one. It just doesn't look appealing to use."
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            "It did not recognize the item I was trying to look for through its name."
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            "[difficulties] searching for specific item"

          <br>
          <li>
            “The interface seems like you're using their website on a mobile browser.”
